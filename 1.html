          <strong>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</strong>
        </a>,
        <br>a standardized system for tagging text files to achieve font, color, graphic,
        <br>and hyperlink effects on World Wide <u>Web</u> pages.

          To understand "HTML" from front to back, let's look at each word that makes up the abbreviation:
        <br>Hypertext: text (often with embeds such as images, too) that is organized in order to connect related items
        <br>Markup: a style guide for typesetting anything to be printed in hardcopy or soft copy format
        <br>Language: a language that a computer system understands and uses to interpret commands.
        <br>HTML determines the structure of web pages. This structure alone is not enough to make a web page look good and interactive. So you'll use assisted technologies such as CSS and JavaScript to make your HTML beautiful and add interactivity, respectively.
